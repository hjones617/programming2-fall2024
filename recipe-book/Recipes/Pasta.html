        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Garlic Parmesan Pasta will have a rich, savory flavor with a nice balance of garlic and the nuttiness of the Parmesan cheese.

The fresh parsley (or basil) brightens the dish, adding a touch of freshness. Overall, it's comforting, satisfying, and perfect for any pasta lover!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta: 8 oz (spaghetti, fettuccine, or your choice)</li>
            <li>Olive oil: 3 tablespoons\</li>

            <li>Garlic: 4 cloves, minced</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes: 1/2 teaspoon (optional, for heat)</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese: 1 cup, grated (plus extra for serving)</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley: 1/4 cup, chopped (or basil, for variation)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper: to taste</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Lemon juice: 1 tablespoon (optional, for brightness)</li>
        
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the Pasta:

In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Sauce:

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes (if using). Sauté for about 1-2 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant and lightly golden—be careful not to burn it!</li>
            <li>Combine:

Add the cooked pasta to the skillet. Toss to coat in the garlic oil. Gradually add reserved pasta water, a little at a time, until you reach your desired consistency.
</li>
            <li>Finish the Dish:

Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If you like, add a squeeze of lemon juice for extra brightness.</li>
            <li>Serve:

Serve hot, garnished with more Parmesan and fresh parsley. Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Tips
You can add veggies (like spinach or cherry tomatoes) or protein (like grilled chicken or shrimp) to make it heartier!
Feel free to adjust the garlic and cheese levels to your taste.
