        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (40g) unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (65g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (90g) chocolate chips or chunks (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour an 8x8-inch (20x20 cm) baking pan or line it with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter: In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter in the microwave or use a double boiler on the stove. Let it cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Mix sugar, eggs, and vanilla: Stir the granulated sugar into the melted butter. Mix in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla extract and stir until combined.</li>
            <li>Combine dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the cocoa powder, flour, salt, and baking powder.</li>
            <li>Add dry ingredients to wet: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
            <li>Fold in chocolate chips (optional): If using chocolate chips or chunks, gently fold them into the batter.</li>
            <li>Pour into pan: Spread the batter evenly in the prepared baking pan.</li>
            <li>Bake: Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. The brownies should look set on the edges but still slightly gooey in the middle.</li>
            <li>Cool and cut: Let the brownies cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares.</li>
        </ol>
