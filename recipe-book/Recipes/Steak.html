        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Steak: 1-1.5 inches thick (ribeye, sirloin, or filet mignon work well)</li>
            <li>Salt: to taste</li>
            <li>Black pepper: to taste</li>
            <li>Olive oil: 2 tablespoons</li>
            <li>Butter: 2 tablespoons</li>
            <li>Garlic: 2 cloves, smashed</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs: (like rosemary or thyme) a few sprigs (optional)</li>
           
        </ul>
          <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Steak:

Take the steak out of the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature (about 30 minutes). This ensures even cooking. Pat it dry with paper towels, then season generously with salt and black pepper on both sides.
</li>
            <li>Heat the Pan:

In a heavy skillet (cast iron is ideal), heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until it’s shimmering but not smoking.</li>
            <li>Sear the Steak:

Place the steak in the hot pan and sear without moving it for about 4-5 minutes, depending on the thickness. When it’s nicely browned, flip it over.
</li>
            <li>Finish the Dish:

Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If you like, add a squeeze of lemon juice for extra brightness.</li>
            <li>SAdd Flavor:

After flipping the steak, add the butter, smashed garlic, and herbs to the pan. As the butter melts, use a spoon to baste the steak with the melted butter for extra flavor.</li>
            <li>TCook to Desired Doneness:

Continue cooking for another 3-5 minutes, depending on your preferred doneness. Use a meat thermometer for accuracy:
Rare: 125°F (52°C)
Medium Rare: 135°F (57°C)
Medium: 145°F (63°C)
Medium Well: 150°F (66°C)
Well Done: 160°F (71°C).
</li>
            <li>Rest the Steak:

Once done, transfer the steak to a cutting board and let it rest for about 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute.</li>
            <li>Serve:

Slice against the grain and serve with any remaining pan juices drizzled over the top.</li>

        </ol>
